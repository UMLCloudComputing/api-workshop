## api-workshop

A repository to help new members learn about APIs and a little bit of Git on the way.

See the RESOURCES.md file for the lesson on APIs. It will cover the following:

1) What is an API?
2) Rest APIs

There is also a demo of a server that simulates CRUD REST API that interacts with a database and a client that makes request to it.
